# Rustful Raytracer

## A raytracer made with rust

This is a simple ray tracer implemented in Rust.

The ray tracer calculates the color of each pixel in an image by tracing rays from the camera through the viewport and into the scene.

### Example usage:

```rust
cargo run > image.ppm
```

This will compile and run the program, generating the ray-traced image.
